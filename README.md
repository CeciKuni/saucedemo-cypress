```
```
$ npm -v
```

-   Cypress: Install from the project folder. This will generate the node_modules folder.
```
$ npm  install cypress --save-dev
```
-   npx library (set of commands to execute scripts).

```
$ npm  install -g npx
```

## Commands

This command allows opening the Cypress interface window and selecting the test type (e2e, browser, and spec, which represents the test to be executed).
```
$ npm run open
```
Alternatively, if you want to run a specific testcase, for example, the login test, without opening the Cypress interface:
```
$ cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/test_login.cy.js --browser chrome
```
To execute tests through the console without opening the browser or the Cypress interface:
```
$ npm run test
```
